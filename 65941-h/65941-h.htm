<p>George Croghan, an officer in the War of 1812, typifies the patriotism, the
bravery, and the gallantry of the young American of that period. At the age of
twenty-one, he was in temporary command of the garrison at Fort Wayne for a
brief time.</p>
<p>His excellent record in the defense of Fort Defiance and Fort Meigs earned
him the command of Fort Stephenson (the present site of Fremont, Ohio). His intelligent
and valorous defense of the fort against overwhelming odds touched the
imaginations and thrilled the hearts of the American people. His later life was uneventful;
he served as United States postmaster at New Orleans and as inspector
general in the regular army. He saw action under General Taylor in the Mexican
War and died of cholera in New Orleans in 1849.</p>
<p>The following account of Croghan&rsquo;s early life, compiled by a woman who had
known him as a boy, appeared in the supplement appended to Volume VII of the
NILES&rsquo; WEEKLY REGISTER. The Boards and the Staff of the Public Library of
Fort Wayne and Allen County reprint this biographical sketch in the hope that it will
prove interesting and entertaining to students of local history. Grammar, spelling,

<p class="t0">Sir:</p>
</div>
<p>Upon receiving the letter which you addressed to me, I immediately took
such measures as were necessary to procure the information you requested. I now
transmit to you the result of my inquiries, regretting that it was not in my power to
do it sooner.</p>
<p>At the time when Colonel Croghan and I were inmates of the same house, he
was in his fourteenth year. No incident occurred during that early period sufficiently
interesting to find a place in his history; yet even then, his conduct exhibited
a happy combination of those talents and principles which have already procured for
him the admiration and gratitude of his country.</p>
<p>Though ingenuous in his disposition and unassuming and conciliating in his
manner, he was remarkable for discretion and steadiness. His opinions, when once
formed, were maintained with modest but persevering firmness; and the propriety
of his decisions generally justified the spirit with which they were defended. Yet,
though rigid in his adherence to principle and in his estimate of what was right or
improper, in cases of minor importance he was all compliance. I never met a youth
who would so cheerfully sacrifice every personal gratification for the wishes or accommodations
of his friends. In sickness and disappointment he evinced patience
and fortitude which could not have been exceeded by any veteran in the schools of
misfortune or philosophy. If I were asked to name the most prominent features of
his character, or, rather, the prevailing dispositions of his mind at this period, I
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
should answer, decision and urbanity; the former resulted from the uncommon and
estimable qualities of his understanding, and the latter came from the concentration
of all the &ldquo;sweet charities of life&rdquo; in his heart.</p>
<p>I have seldom seen Colonel Croghan during the last eight years; but I subjoin
the testimony of those who have observed him during that whole period. An intelligent
young gentleman who was his associate in study and in arms has given me the
following brief sketch of Colonel Croghan&rsquo;s military career. I am transmitting his
account together with such corroborative and additional facts as I have collected
from other sources.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Colonel George Croghan was born at Locust Grove, Kentucky,
near the Falls of the Ohio, on November 15, 1791. His father, Major William
Croghan, left Ireland at an early period of his life; he was appointed an officer in
the Revolutionary Army and discharged his duties to the satisfaction of the commander
in chief. His mother is the daughter of John Clark, Esq., of Virginia. His
maternal grandfather was a gentleman of worth and respectability; he exerted himself
and contributed towards the support of our just and glorious contest with Great
Britain. John Clark had five sons, four of whom were officers in the Revolutionary
Army. William, together with Captain Lewis, explored the Louisiana Purchase
lands and is at present governor of the Missouri Territory. He was too young to
participate with his brothers in the achievement of our liberties. His conduct since
has been a sufficient demonstration of the part he would have taken had he been
riper in years. The military talents of another son, George R. Clark, have obtained
for him the flattering appellation of &lsquo;the Father of the Western Country.&rsquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Croghan has always been esteemed generous and humane. When
he was a boy, his manly appearance and independence of thought and action commanded
the attention and admiration of all who knew him. The selection of his speeches
for scholastic exercises tended in some measure to mark his peculiar talent and
were of an entirely military nature. He read with delight whatever pertained to
military affairs and listened for hours to conversations dealing with battles. His
principal amusements were gunning and fox hunting. He would frequently rise at
twelve o&rsquo;clock at night and would repair to the woods alone (or accompanied only by
his little servant), either to give chase to the fox or to battle with the wildcat and
the raccoon. Nothing offended him more than for anyone, even in jest, to say a
word disrespectful of Washington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While in Kentucky, his time was principally occupied with the studies of his
native tongue, geography, the elements of geometry, and the Latin and Greek languages.
In these different branches of knowledge he made a respectable progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1808, he left Locust Grove for the purpose of prosecuting his studies in
William and Mary College. He graduated from this institution with a Bachelor of
Arts degree on July 4, 1810; on that day he delivered an oration on the subject of
expatriation. This oration was deemed by the audience to be concise, ingenious,
and argumentative, and it was delivered in a manner which did great credit to his
oratorical powers. During the ensuing summer he attended a course of lectures on
law, and upon the termination of the course, he returned to his father&rsquo;s home. Here
he prosecuted the study of law and occasionally indulged in miscellaneous reading.
Biography and history have always occupied much of his attention. He is an enthusiastic
admirer of the writings of Shakespeare and can recite most of the noted passages
of that great poet and philosopher. He admires tragedy but not comedy. He
has (as his countenance indicates) a serious mind; yet no one admires a pleasant
anecdote or an unaffected sally of wit more than he. With his friends he is affable
and free from reserve. His manners are prepossessing, he dislikes ostentation,
and he has never been heard to utter a word in praise of himself.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the autumn of 1811, the Battle of Tippecanoe was fought; it was the first
opportunity offered for the display of his military talents. He embraced it with avidity&mdash;he
left his father&rsquo;s house as a volunteer and was appointed aid-de-camp to
General Harrison. On November 7, an attack was made on General Harrison&rsquo;s
troops; the enemy were repulsed with valor, and during the engagement young
Croghan evinced great courage, activity, and military skill. His services were
acknowledged by all; he exhibited such proofs of genius for war that many of his
companions-in-arms remarked that &lsquo;he was born a soldier.&rsquo; A cant phrase among
the troops was &lsquo;to do a main business&rsquo;; during the battle, Croghan rode from post to
post exciting the courage of the men by exclaiming, &lsquo;Now, my brave fellows, now is
the time to do a main business!&rsquo; On the return march of the troops following the
battle, the army was frequently met by persons inquiring of the soldiers the fates of
their children or friends. Among these was a very poor and aged man whose son
had been slain in battle. Croghan learned of the old man&rsquo;s plight, observed his inability
to perform much bodily labor, regularly made fires for him every morning,
and supplied him with provisions, clothes, and money. Many accounts of similar
acts of kindness are related by the soldiers and officers of this campaign.</p>

<p class="pcap">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;<i>HAVING WADED THROUGH MUD</i>&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;After the Battle of Tippecanoe his military ardor was even more increased,
and, upon hearing that a speedy declaration of war was forthcoming, he expressed
a desire to join the regular army. Recommendatory letters of the most flattering
kind were written by Generals Harrison and Boyd to the Secretary of War; at the
commencement of hostilities against Great Britain, he was appointed a captain in
the Seventeenth Regiment of Infantry. He was in command for some time at Clark
Cantonment [Clarksville, Indiana], near the Falls of the Ohio; but after a brief
period there he was ordered to march with his few regulars to the headquarters of
the Northwestern Army at Detroit. His countenance beamed with delight upon receiving
this order. Soon large bodies of militia and volunteers were marching to
Detroit; but before they had proceeded far they heard of Hull&rsquo;s surrender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shortly afterwards the command of the Northwestern Army was given to
General Harrison. For a short time, Captain Croghan commanded Fort Defiance
on the Maumee River; after the defeat of General Winchester, he was ordered to
Fort Meigs. His conduct during the unforgettable siege of that fort was handsomely
noted in General Harrison&rsquo;s official report, and afterwards he was promoted to a
majority and stationed with his battalion at Upper Sandusky. Late one afternoon information
reached him by express of an attack upon Fort Stephenson [Fremont].
The distance between the two places was thirty-six miles, and the road was extremely
bad. Because of the pitch darkness he and his men were obliged to lie down
in the road and wait for the return of light in order to avoid the risk of losing their
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He arrived at Fort Ball before sunrise the next morning, having waded
waist deep through mud and mire and having been exposed to a heavy rain during the
whole night. There he was informed that the report of an attack upon Fort Stephenson
was unfounded; after remaining a few days, he proceeded to Fort Stephenson,
after receiving orders to take command of that post. He arrived there about the
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
fifteenth of July.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few days later, Fort Meigs was besieged by large British and Indian
forces. No doubt was entertained that the enemy would visit Fort Stephenson; accordingly,
Major Croghan labored day and night to place the hastily built fort in a
state of readiness. The necessity of cutting a ditch around the fort became apparent
to him immediately. In order to foil the enemy if they should succeed in leaping
the ditch, which was nine feet wide and six feet deep, he had large logs placed on
the tops of the walls. The logs were adjusted so that a slight weight would cause
them to fall from their position and crush to death all below. This improvement in
the art of fortification took place only a few days before the attack. It is a novel
idea and it originated with Croghan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A short time before the action, he wrote the following concise and impressive
letter to a friend: &lsquo;The enemy are not far distant&mdash;I expect an attack&mdash;I will
defend this post to the last extremity. I have just sent away the women and children
with the sick of the garrison that I may be able to act without encumbrances.
Be satisfied; I shall, I hope, do my duty. The example set me by my revolutionary
kindred is before me; let me die rather than prove unworthy of their name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the afternoon of the first day of August, the attack upon Fort Stephenson
was commenced. The particulars of that memorable and brilliant action can be
found in General Harrison&rsquo;s official account of this period. A lucid statement of the
honorable motives which influenced Colonel Croghan&rsquo;s conduct on that occasion is
contained in an &lsquo;extract of a letter from himself to his friend in Seneca Town, dated
August 27, 1813.&rsquo; These accounts and other interesting particulars will be found in
public prints issued between August 14 and September 16.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Major Croghan&rsquo;s conduct after the battle was as noble as it had been during
the hardest fighting. The wounded were treated by him with the greatest tenderness;
with considerable peril, he gave them water by means of buckets let down by ropes
to the outside of the pickets. During the night, when he could not safely open the
fort, he had a tunnel dug under the wall and through it the wounded were conveyed
into the fort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Croghan accompanied General Harrison to Malden, but, as the brigade
to which he was attached was stationed there, he did not participate in the
Battle of the Thames. He is remarkable as a disciplinarian, and his orders are
given with more promptness, precision, and energy than are usually found in the
orders of older and more experienced commanders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have appended the following extract of a letter written by one of Colonel
Croghan&rsquo;s fellow students and fellow soldiers. It will throw additional light on the
military character of that distinguished young officer.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel George Croghan is a native of Kentucky; he is the second
son of Major William Croghan of near Louisville. He is the nephew of the gallant
hero and accomplished general, George Rogers Clark, the Father of the Western
Country, and of General William Clark, the present enterprising governor of the
Missouri Territory. His father, a native of Ireland who early embarked to seek his
fortune in America, was a distinguished officer in the War of the Revolution.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Croghan was born on November 15, 1791, and received
all the advantages of education which the best grammar schools in Kentucky could
afford; in his seventeenth year he commenced a scientific course at William and
Mary College in Virginia. In school and college he was known for his manliness of
character, his elevation of sentiment, and his strength of intellect; all these virtues
were connected with a high and persevering ambition.</p>

<p class="pcap">&middot;&middot;<i>THE WOUNDED WERE TREATED BY HIM WITH THE GREATEST TENDERNESS</i>&middot;&middot;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>In July, 1810, he graduated at William and Mary College, and soon afterwards
he commenced the study of law. He continued to visit that institution until
the fall of 1811, when he volunteered his services for a campaign up the Wabash. A
short time before the action at Tippecanoe, he was appointed aid-de-camp in General
Harrison&rsquo;s headquarters. Although in his situation he was unable to evince that
activity which later distinguished him, he exhibited an undaunted soul in one of the
most sanguinary conflicts of the present day and received the thanks of the commanding
general.</p>
<p>In consequence of his services on the Wabash expedition, he was appointed a
captain in the provisional army which was directed to be raised and organized in the
spring of 1812. In August of that year he marched with General Winchester&rsquo;s Kentucky
detachment, which was to relieve General Hull in Canada. In the movements
of that gallant but unfortunate little army, the caution, zeal, and military capacity
of Captain Croghan were conspicuous. Both before and after the attack on Fort
Wayne, the ground occupied by Captain Croghan was easily noticed because of the
judicious fortifications erected in his areas. On the march of the army toward
Detroit, he was entrusted with the command of Fort Defiance, at the junction of the
Auglaize and Maumee rivers. There he manifested his usual excellent military arrangements.
After the defeat at Raisin River, he joined General Harrison at Maumee
Rapids before the erection of Fort Meigs.</p>
<p>It is a credit to the discernment of General Harrison that he relied with the
utmost confidence on Captain Croghan&rsquo;s judicious defenses during the difficult siege
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
of Fort Meigs by the British. In a sortie under the gallant Colonel Millar on May 5,
the companies led by Captains Croghan, Laghan, and Bradford were given the task
of storming the British batteries. These positions were defended by an English
force and a body of Indians; both were superior in number to the assailants. Here
Captain Croghan&rsquo;s gallantry was again noticed in general orders.</p>
<p>At a very critical period in the last campaign of 1813, young Croghan, now
a major, was appointed to the command of Fort Stephenson, at Lower Sandusky.
The official documents of the time and the applause of a grateful country are the
most honorable commentaries available concerning his conduct in the defense of
that post. The entire campaign was changed from a defensive to an offensive operation.
The eventual outcome of the war was very materially influenced by the
achievements of that single battle. For his valor and good conduct on this occasion,
Major Croghan was breveted a lieutenant colonel.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
